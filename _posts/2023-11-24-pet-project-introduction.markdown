One of the most effective methods to learn something is to try something. 
My way of learning new things is developing and prototyping.

Recently I've finished one of my own project - Menu. Is the bot which takes from user names of dishes 
and returns random name of dish. This helps me to choose options when I don't know what I want to eat.

Main goals I've set for this project: 
* consolidate knowledge of docker and it's environment;
* consolidate knowledge of CI/CD with Github Actions;
* gain experience with deployment and hosting app by using docker swarm.
